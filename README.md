# Surprise Minimization Liquid Neural Network

Implementation of a real-time learning AI model combining Liquid Time Constant Neural Networks with surprise minimization-based learning rules.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an AI model that combines Liquid Time Constant (LTC) Neural Networks with a surprise minimization-based learning rule to achieve real-time, unsupervised learning capable of human-like problem-solving routines.

### Key Components

1. Liquid Time Constant Neural Networks
2. Surprise Minimization Learning Rules
3. Real-time, Online Learning
4. STDP-like Plasticity Implementation
